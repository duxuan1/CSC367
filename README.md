Low-level parallelism, performance analysis, profiling, etc.

Parallel programming concepts, parallel algorithm design, parallel task decomposition, data partitioning strategies, concurrency, load balancing, scalability and speedup, efficiency, etc.

Shared address space programming (Parallelization using pthreads, OpenMP, etc.)

Synchronization problems (race conditions, critical sections, synchronization primitives like locks and condition variables, barriers, solving synchronization problems, etc.)
Message passing paradigm, Collective operations, MPI framework

GPUs, CUDA architecture, memory model, streams, etc.
